# ⚡ EVision – EV Charging Forecasting & Location Planner

EVision is a **capstone project** that predicts the demand for EV charging stations and helps plan optimal locations.  
Currently focused on the **Mumbai region**, the system can easily scale to other cities or countries as relevant data becomes available.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **EV Charging Demand Forecasting**  
  Machine Learning models trained to achieve **over 90% accuracy** in predicting future charging demand.

- **Location Planning**  
  Suggests strategic sites for setting up new charging stations based on forecasted demand and regional factors.

- **Web-Based Dashboard**  
  A clean, interactive frontend built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for showcasing predictions and maps.

- **Scalable Design**  
  The pipeline and architecture can quickly adapt to additional regions when more data is provided.
